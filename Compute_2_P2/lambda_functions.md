# Optimizing a Lambda Functions
- How to mesure performance in an app.

**End To End**
- Use a tool similar to Locust which measures 
    - average response time
    - maximum response time
    - 90th percentiles
    - failure rate
    - requests per sec

_End-to-end_ metrics include network latency and other AWS service durations, not just Lambda duration time.
