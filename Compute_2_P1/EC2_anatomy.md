# Understanding the AWS EC2 Anatomy
An Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance is a virtual server in the cloud that 
uses a hypervisor to partition a portion of the host's physical hardware components (storage, 
networking, compute).

The majority of Amazon EC2 instances run on hardware known as the AWS Nitro System.

- The AWS Nitro System is built specifically to run instances in the most optimal way possible.
